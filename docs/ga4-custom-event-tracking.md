# BlueFinch Checkout - GA4 Custom Event Tracking

The BlueFinch Checkout supports custom events to be tracked throughout the checkout journey allowing you to do more granular reporting on the performance of your checkout within GA4. 

There is a pre-made json container that can be imported and merged into your existing GTM container. This can be downloaded from [here](downloads/bluefinchcheckout-gtm-example-complete-with-add-to-cart-purchase.json). 

This json file includes all the Data layer Variables, Tags and Triggers for all the events that work with the BlueFinch Checkout including pre-set up GA4 events. 

**GA4 Events will need to be amended to include your G-tag Measurement ID.**

To change this edit each GA4 event and remove the G-00000 measurement ID and fill in with your correct ID.
